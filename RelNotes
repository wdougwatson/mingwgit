Git ???? Release Notes
======================

Updates since v2.3
------------------

Ports


UI, Workflows & Features

 * The command usage info strings given by "git cmd -h" and in
   documentation have been tweaked for consistency.

 * The "sync" subcommand of "git p4" now allows users to exclude
   subdirectories like its "clone" subcommand does.

 * "git log --invert-grep --grep=WIP" will show only commits that do
   not have the string "WIP" in their messages.

 * "git push" has been taught a "--atomic" option that makes push to
   update more than one ref an "all-or-none" affair.

 * Extending the "push to deploy" added in 2.3, the behaviour of "git
   push" when updating the branch that is checked out can now be
   tweaked by push-to-checkout hook.

 * Using environment variable LANGUAGE and friends on the client side,
   HTTP-based transports now send Accept-Language when making requests.


Performance, Internal Implementation, Development Support etc.

 * Implementation of N_() macro has been updated slightly to help us
   detect mistakes.

 * Implementation of "reflog expire" has been restructured to fit the
   reflogs better with the recently updated ref API.


Also contains various documentation updates and code clean-ups.


Fixes since v2.3
----------------

Unless otherwise noted, all the fixes since v2.3 in the maintenance
track are contained in this release (see the maintenance releases'
notes for details).

 * "git blame HEAD -- missing" failed to correctly say "HEAD" when it
   tried to say "No such path 'missing' in HEAD".
   (merge a46442f jk/blame-commit-label later to maint).

 * "git rerere" (invoked internally from many mergy operations) did
   not correctly signal errors when told to update the working tree
   files and failed to do so for whatever reason.
   (merge 89ea903 jn/rerere-fail-on-auto-update-failure later to maint).

 * Setting diff.submodule to 'log' made "git format-patch" produce
   broken patches.
   (merge 339de50 dk/format-patch-ignore-diff-submodule later to maint).

 * After attempting and failing a password-less authentication
   (e.g. kerberos), libcURL refuses to fall back to password based
   Basic authentication without a bit of help/encouragement.
   (merge 4dbe664 bc/http-fallback-to-password-after-krb-fails later to maint).

 * The "git push" documentation made the "--repo=<there>" option
   easily misunderstood.
   (merge 57b92a7 mg/push-repo-option-doc later to maint).

 * Code to read branch name from various files in .git/ directory
   would have misbehaved if the code to write them left an empty file.
   (merge 66ec904 jk/status-read-branch-name-fix later to maint).

 * A misspelled conditional that is always true has been fixed.
   (merge 94ee8e2 jk/remote-curl-an-array-in-struct-cannot-be-null later to maint).

 * The documentation incorrectly said that C(opy) and R(ename) are the
   only ones that can be followed by the score number in the output in
   the --raw format.
   (merge ac1c2d9 jc/diff-format-doc later to maint).

 * A broken pack .idx file in the receiving repository prevented the
   dumb http transport from fetching a good copy of it from the other
   side.
   (merge 8b9c2dd jk/dumb-http-idx-fetch-fix later to maint).

 * The error message from "git commit", when a non-existing author
   name was given as value to the "--author=" parameter, has been
   reworded to avoid misunderstanding.
   (merge 1044b1f mg/commit-author-no-match-malformed-message later to maint).

 * "git log --help" used to show rev-list options that are irrelevant
   to the "log" command.
   (merge 3cab02d jc/doc-log-rev-list-options later to maint).

 * "git apply --whitespace=fix" used to under-allocate the memory when
   the fix resulted in a longer text than the original patch.
   (merge 407a792 jc/apply-ws-fix-expands later to maint).

 * The interactive "show a list and let the user choose from it"
   interface "add -i" used showed and prompted to the user even when
   the candidate list was empty, against which the only "choice" the
   user could have made was to choose nothing.
   (merge a9c4641 ak/add-i-empty-candidates later to maint).

 * The insn sheet "git rebase -i" creates did not fully honor
   core.abbrev settings.
   (merge edb72d5 ks/rebase-i-abbrev later to maint).

 * "git fetch" over a remote-helper that cannot respond to "list"
   command could not fetch from a symbolic reference e.g. HEAD.
   (merge 33cae54 mh/deref-symref-over-helper-transport later to maint).

 * "git push --signed" gave an incorrectly worded error message when
   the other side did not support the capability.
   (merge 45917f0 jc/push-cert later to maint).

 * We didn't format an integer that wouldn't fit in "int" but in
   "uintmax_t" correctly.
   (merge d306f3d jk/decimal-width-for-uintmax later to maint).

 * Reading configuration from a blob object, when it ends with a lone
   CR, use to confuse the configuration parser.
   (merge 1d0655c jk/config-no-ungetc-eof later to maint).

 * The pack bitmap support did not build with older versions of GCC.
   (merge bd4e882 jk/pack-bitmap later to maint).

 * The documentation wasn't clear that "remote.<nick>.pushURL" and
   "remote.<nick>.URL" are there to name the same repository accessed
   via different transports, not two separate repositories.
   (merge 697f652 jc/remote-set-url-doc later to maint).

 * Older GnuPG implementations may not correctly import the keyring
   material we prepare for the tests to use.
   (merge 1f985d6 ch/new-gpg-drops-rfc-1991 later to maint).

 * The credential helper for Windows (in contrib/) used to mishandle
   a user name with an at-sign in it.
   (merge 13d261e av/wincred-with-at-in-username-fix later to maint).

 * Longstanding configuration variable naming rules has been added to
   the documentation.
   (merge 35840a3 jc/conf-var-doc later to maint).

 * An earlier workaround to squelch unhelpful deprecation warnings
   from the complier on Mac OSX unnecessarily set minimum required
   version of the OS, which the user might want to raise (or lower)
   for other reasons.
   (merge 88c03eb es/squelch-openssl-warnings-on-macosx later to maint).

 * Certain older vintages of cURL give irregular output from
   "curl-config --vernum", which confused our build system.
   (merge 3af6792 tc/curl-vernum-output-broken-in-7.11 later to maint).

 * In v2.2.0, we broke "git prune" that runs in a repository that
   borrows from an alternate object store.
   (merge b0a4264 jk/prune-mtime later to maint).

 * "git submodule add" failed to squash "path/to/././submodule" to
   "path/to/submodule".
   (merge 8196e72 ps/submodule-sanitize-path-upon-add later to maint).

 * "git merge-file" did not work correctly in a subdirectory.
   (merge 204a8ff ab/merge-file-prefix later to maint).

 * "git blame" died, trying to free an uninitialized piece of memory.
   (merge e600592 es/blame-commit-info-fix later to maint).

Git v2.2 Release Notes
======================

Updates since v2.1
------------------

UI, Workflows & Features

 * "git config --edit --global" starts from a skeletal per-user
   configuration file contents, instead of a total blank, when the
   user does not already have any.  This immediately reduces the
   need for a later "Have you forgotten setting core.user?" and we
   can add more to the template as we gain more experience.


Performance, Internal Implementation, etc.

 * Looking up remotes configuration in a repository with very many
   remotes defined has been optimized.

 * There are cases where you lock and open to write a file, close it
   to show the updated contents to external processes, and then have
   to update the file again while still holding the lock, but the
   lockfile API lacked support for such an access pattern.

 * An in-core caching layer to let us avoid reading the same
   configuration files number of times has been added.

 * Various code paths have been cleaned up and simplified by using
   "strbuf", "starts_with()", and "skip_prefix()" APIs more.


Also contains various documentation updates and code clean-ups.


Fixes since v2.1
----------------

 * "git log --pretty/format=" with an empty format string did not
   mean the more obvious "No output whatsoever" but "Use default
   format", which was counterintuitive.
   (merge b9c7d6e jk/pretty-empty-format later to maint).

 * Implementations of "tar" that do not understand an extended pax
   header would extract the contents of it in a regular file; make
   sure the permission bits of this file follows the same tar.umask
   configuration setting.


Unless otherwise noted, all the fixes since v2.1 in the maintenance
track are contained in this release (see the maintenance releases'
notes for details).

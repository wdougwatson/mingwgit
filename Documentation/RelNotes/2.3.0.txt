Git v2.3 Release Notes
======================

Updates since v2.2
------------------

Ports

 *

UI, Workflows & Features

 * It was cumbersome to use "GIT_SSH" mechanism when the user wanted
   to pass an extra set of arguments to the underlying ssh.  A new
   environment variable GIT_SSH_COMMAND can be used for this.

 * A request to store an empty note via "git notes" meant to remove
   note from the object but with --allow-empty we will store a
   (surprise!)  note that is empty.


Performance, Internal Implementation, Development Support etc.

 *


Also contains various documentation updates and code clean-ups.


Fixes since v2.2
----------------

Unless otherwise noted, all the fixes since v2.2 in the maintenance
track are contained in this release (see the maintenance releases'
notes for details).

 * "git checkout $treeish $path", when $path in the index and the
   working tree already matched what is in $treeish at the $path,
   still overwrote the $path unnecessarily.
   (merge c5326bd jk/checkout-from-tree later to maint).

 * "git config --get-color" did not parse its command line arguments
   carefully.
   (merge cb35722 jk/colors-fix later to maint).

 * open() emulated on Windows platforms did not give EISDIR upon
   an attempt to open a directory for writing.
   (merge ba6fad0 js/windows-open-eisdir-error later to maint).

 * A few code paths used abs() when they should have used labs() on
   long integers.
   (merge 83915ba rs/maint-config-use-labs later to maint).
   (merge 31a8aa1 rs/receive-pack-use-labs later to maint).

 * "gitweb" used to depend on a behaviour recent CGI.pm deprecated.
   (merge 13dbf46 jk/gitweb-with-newer-cgi-multi-param later to maint).

 * "git init" (hence "git clone") initialized the per-repository
   configuration file .git/config with x-bit by mistake.
   (merge 1f32ecf mh/config-flip-xbit-back-after-checking later to maint).

 * Git 2.0 was supposed to make the "simple" mode for the default of
   "git push", but it didn't.
   (merge 00a6fa0 jk/push-simple later to maint).

 * "Everyday" document had a broken link.
   (merge 366c8d4 po/everyday-doc later to maint).

 * A few test fixes.
   (merge 880ef58 jk/no-perl-tests later to maint).

 * The build procedure did not bother fixing perl and python scripts
   when NO_PERL and NO_PYTHON build-time configuration changed.
   (merge ca2051d jk/rebuild-perl-scripts-with-no-perl-seting-change later to maint).

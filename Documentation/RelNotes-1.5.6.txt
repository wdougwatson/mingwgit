GIT v1.5.6 Release Notes
========================

Updates since v1.5.5
--------------------

(subsystems)


(portability)


(performance)

* "git rebase --onto $there $from $branch" used to switch to the tip of
  $branch only to immediately reset back to $from, smudging work tree
  files unnecessarily.  This has been optimized.

(usability, bells and whistles)

* "git add -p" (and the "patch" subcommand of "git add -i") can choose to
  apply (or not apply) mode changes independently from contents changes.

* "git bisect help" gives longer and more helpful usage information.

* "git diff/log --dirstat" output is consistent between binary and textual
  changes.

* "git gc --auto" honors a new pre-aut-gc hook to temporarily disable it.

* "git log --pretty=tformat:<custom format>" gives a LF after each entry,
  instead of giving a LF between each pair of entries which is how
  "git log --pretty=format:<custom format>" works.

* "git send-email" now can send out messages outside a git repository.

* "git status" can optionally include output from "git submodule
  summary".

* "gitweb" can read from a system-wide configuration file.

(internal)

* "git unpack-objects" and "git receive-pack" is now more strict about
  detecting breakage in the objects they receive over the wire.


Fixes since v1.5.5
